**Project Overview:**

User is working on a project to build a website that animates and allows interaction with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The project involves visualizing various data structures, including Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Tries, and Union Find. The website will be interactive, allowing users to test with their own input, and it will feature drag-and-drop functionality for manipulating these data structures.

User plans to animate the Bubble Sort algorithm first across all data structures and focus on handling basic functionality initially, with future improvements planned for edge cases and advanced features.

**Technologies to Learn and Use:**
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Open to learning React for dynamic UI and using libraries such as React DnD for drag-and-drop and GSAP for animations.
- User plans to use vanilla JavaScript for the drag-and-drop functionality and animations at the start, before expanding into more advanced tools and libraries.

**Key Points to Remember:**
- The project will start with a simple implementation of Bubble Sort across various data structures.
- User will learn tools and libraries like React, React DnD, and GSAP gradually as they progress.
- The goal is to make the website interactive, where users can input their data and watch the sorting algorithm visualize in real-time.

**Tone and Approach:**
- Provide clear, step-by-step guidance on implementing features (drag-and-drop, animation).
- Focus on helping the user learn and understand the technologies being used, explaining any tools and concepts as needed.
- Offer practical advice and code examples tailored to the userâ€™s current skill level, especially in areas such as vanilla JavaScript, React, and animation.
